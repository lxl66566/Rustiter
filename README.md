# Rustiter

Rust-inspired iterator utilities for Python. This library implements **most of** the functions from the [Rust Iterator trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html).

## Why

I'm a big fan of chaining function calls, but Python's functional programming tools can be cumbersome. No one really wants to use the built-in `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions.

I previously experimented with [simpleufcs](https://github.com/lxl66566/simpleufcs), which allows for chainable function calls in Python.

This library offers an alternative: while it doesn't provide full UFCS (Uniform Function Call Syntax), it performs slightly better and brings many useful functions from Rustâ€™s iterator design, such as `take`, `flat_map`, and more. If you're familiar with Rust and not too concerned about performance, you'll likely enjoy using this.

## Installation

```sh
pip install rustiter
```

## Example

Here are some commonly used functions:

```py
from rustiter import rter
ret = (
    rter(range(10))
    .filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
    .map(lambda x: x + 1)
    .take(3)
    .collect()
)
assert ret == [1, 3, 5]
assert rter(range(10)).reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, 0) == 45
```

Additional Information: **Every function** includes a doctest to demonstrate its usage.

### Mutability

The mutability of Python's iterator is not ideal. Therefore, I marked the mutability of the functions as follows:

- `[Mut]`: The iterator may be modified after this operation. If there's not a `retains = ...`, the rest elements is undefined.
- `[UnMut]`: The iterator will not be modified.
- `[Consume]`: The iterator may be consumed after this operation. Note that this **does not** mean the iterator will become empty; there may still be elements in it. This means that you should not use this iterator again.
